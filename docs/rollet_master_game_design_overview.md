# Roll-et — Master Game Design Overview

## 1. Purpose & Scope
Roll-et is a PWA-based, offline-first dice game inspired by roulette, with a single d20 roll driving each round. 
This document consolidates all game rules, player flow, and contract definitions into a single design reference for development and auditing.

## 2. Game Flow

- **Round States:**
  1. **Join** — Players scan House QR and take a seat (max 4).
  2. **Betting** — Players place credits onto betting mat options.
  3. **Locked** — Bets freeze, Bet Certs issued.
  4. **Resolved** — House rolls d20, result recorded.
  5. **Settled** — Credits liquidated to winnings/losses → tender or BANK.

- **Betting Options:**
  - Single numbers → 18:1 payout.
  - Splits → 8:1 payout.
  - Quarters included.
  - No thirds, Lucky 7, or prime/composite bets.

## 3. Credit Economy

- **Buy-in:** 4 credits per player per round.
- **Cap:** 8 credits maximum per round.
- **Valuation:** House sets credit value at round start (increments of $0.25, max $10.00).
- **Normalization Ceiling (Global Analytics):** $1,440 max per player per round (8 × 18:1 × $10).
- **Local Variance:** Houses may operate at any valuation within rules, but ledger sync always normalizes to $1,440 ceiling.
- **Settlement:** No carry-over of credits. Winnings = tender or BANK receipts.

## 5. Security Model

- **Offline trust:** Players require no internet after install; Houses sync periodically.
- **Integrity:** Bet hashes, receipt IDs, sequential ledger.

- **Privacy:** Player IDs pseudonymous; no PII or raw hardware fingerprints.
- **Auditability:** Backend ensures full traceability from Root Authority → House Cert → round artifacts.

## 6. Error & Recovery
